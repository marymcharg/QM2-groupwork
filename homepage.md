| |Hey, I’m Mary and I’m majoring in Sciences and Engineering. I love popular culture, communication and art, and when I’m not writing articles for Sci-Fi and Fantasy society’s blog, I moonlight as a computer science and Russian language student. I’d love to explore data journalism once I leave university!|Hi! I major in Sciences and Engineering, with a focus on maths and its related subjects. I’m also really interested in music and the arts, and I play piano and draw in my spare time. I would love to learn more about using programming, machine learning and data science to manipulate and analyse data in research.|        | Hi, I'm Julie, and I'm majoring in Cultures. I'm deeply interested in languages and human cultures, focusing on Linguistics and Anthropology in my studies. I am invested in all forms of art and would love to explore the ways in which data science and analysis can teach us about cultural landscapes of modern and past societies.       |I am a 2nd year BASc student majoring in societies focusing on ethics, world politics and law. I am also interested in photography, philosophy and in my spare time I read and draw. I think data management skills are very useful in all disciplines. Then, even if I am not particularly good at it, I would like to learn more about it and improve my skills.
