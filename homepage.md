| |Hey, I’m Mary and I’m majoring in Sciences and Engineering. I love popular culture, communication and art, and when I’m not writing articles for Sci-Fi and Fantasy society’s blog, I moonlight as a computer science and Russian language student. I’d love to explore data journalism once I leave university!|       |        |       |
