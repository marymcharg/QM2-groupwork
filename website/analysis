Percentage of women;
In this line graph we can observe the evolution of the percentage of women in the UK between 1970 and 2010, compared to the percentage of artist women in top charts of music in the same period of time. In the first two decades, the female representation in top artists lists increased by 10%, and then stabilized around 75% from 1981 to 2011. 

We found that the percentage of female artists in the top charts has always been greater than men, and that the female percentage increased by 10% from the 1970s to reach 73% in the 1980s and plateaued at that throughout the rest of the decades. This observation differed from our expectations, given that we assumed there would be more gender disparities with women being underrepresented. Perhaps this could be because the timeframe we analysed is quite contemporary and reflects a fairly liberalised society as our timeframe does not go further back to the decades before 2nd wave feminism. 

Perhaps our results differed significantly from the 2018 University of Southern California study as we analysed weekly top 40 songs from Official Charts, whereas the USC study looked at Billboard’s year-end hot 100 chart. The difference in the unit of time examined could suggest that people listened to female artists whenever there was a new release that week, pushing the female artist’s’ song on the top charts for the week, whereas male artists were ultimately more popular over the course of a year, thus making it to the Billboard year-end chart.
