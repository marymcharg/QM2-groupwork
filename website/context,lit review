Research question: Has top-ranking popular music in the UK reflected increasing cultural globalisation? (1971 - 2011)

Intro
Popular music has historically been any non-folk music that acquired popularity amongst the masses. After the industrial revolution, technology and the increasing dominance 
of the middle classes allowed the democratisation of music increasing its audience and therefore giving way to the development of popular music. Nowadays, popular music is 
commercially orientated and aimed to a wide audience, and is usually written by known artists. [1] 

Aims of the Research
We are interested in exploring to what extent does popular music in the UK reflect cultural globalisation changes in society between 1971 and 2011. We would like to analyse 
how globalisation affects popular music consumption as borders around music are being erased due to accessible platforms like Spotify and Youtube. The recent success of 
foreign-language songs such as Despacito by the Latin-American artists Daddy Yankee and Luis Fonsi, and K-pop groups like BTS seem to mark a new era in which Western pop
music is opening up its borders. Yet, the industry  lacks inclusivity as it still has not fully caught up with global social movements such as internationalism and feminism. International genres of music, ethnicities and women remain underrepresented. 

Context and literature review

Influence of globalisation

A study by Amanda Brandellero and Marc Verboord (2016) examines the extent to which the pop charts are globalized between 1960 and 2010, 
as seen from percentage of hits of foreign origin they contain. They find that between 1960-80, Norway, Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and Australia had the most globalised 
charts with 75% to 95% of foreign acts whereas the United Kingdom had one of the least globalised charts (mostly below 50% or 40%). 
However, after 1980 the pattern changed: the year 1985 is the first one in the sample of study in which the rise of the video clip and music television fueled globalization
in almost every country. UK pop music becomes increasingly globalised, whereas in contrast, the United States increasingly turned to their own music, hitting an all-time 
low of 8.8% foreign hits in 2005. While the U.S.’s inward focus on its national music is most prominent, another study by Achterberg and Heilbron (2011) found that from 1990s to 2000s, the popularity of national music in France, Germany and the Netherlands also increased.

Simone Varriale (2016) argues that many European, Asian, African and South-American increasingly imported British and American music in the 70s and 80s, which some 
considered as  American cultural imperialism due to their economic power which enabled them to dominate their products abroad. However, in the 1990s a different argument 
emerged, which believed that “media audiences were not passive, but were able to appropriate cultural products in innovative ways,” hence globalisation did not necessarily
mean Americanisation.

Gender related studies
A 2018 study by University of Southern California found that of the 600 top songs on Billboard’s year-end hot 100 chart from 2012-2017, only 22.4 percent of artists were women. And amongst the 899 individuals who have been nominated for the last 6 Grammy ceremonies, 90.7 percent were men while only 9.3 percent were women. A study by La France et al. (2011) looked at gender and the Billboard top 40 charts between 1997 and 2007, and found that women chart less frequently, but when they do, they chart higher than men. They also noted that the gender inequality is greatest among group ensembles than solo artists, since the hit songs by male groups more than doubled that of female groups.
